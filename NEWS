Changes in version 0.3-3

BUG FIXES
    o   Updated rangeMapFetch methods to avoid https://github.com/r-dbi/RSQLite/issues/65


Changes in version 0.3-0
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o   View_rmap() project viewer replaces the RangeMapper() GUI.
    o   RangeMap.fetch(spatial = FALSE) returns a rmap.frame object.
    o   Plot(rmap.frame-object) is based on ggplot2.
    o   If a parallel backend is registered processRanges() runs in parallel.
    o   processRanges() allows all sql data types when saving metadata
        (contributed by Joan Maspons).
    o   when FUN is an R function rangeMapSave() can run in parallel
        (contributed by Joan Maspons).
    o   ramp() is a quick alternative to initiate a project; it combines
        all the functions from rangeMap.start() to processRanges() and
        rangeMap.save() but is less flexible as compared with an incremental
        project building.

NEW FUNCTIONS
    o View_rmap()        shiny-based project viewer.
    o as.rmap.frame()    data.table to rmap.frame conversion
    o tables()           sqlite databse summary.
    o rangeMapProjInfo() rangeMap sqlite project summary.
    o ramp()             a quick project starter.
    o theme_rangemap()   a ggplot theme
    o palette_rangemap() a color palette.


Changes in version 0.2-8
BUG FIXES
    o   The package works now with RSQLite (>= 1.0.0).

Changes in version 0.2-7
NEW FEATURES
    o   WKT2SpatialPolygonsDataFrame()


Changes in version 0.2-6
BUG FIXES
    o   fixed a bug in bio.merge().

Changes in version 0.2-4
NEW FEATURES
    o    The old tcltk GUI has been replaced with a GUI based on shiny.

Changes in version 0.2-3
NEW FEATURES
    o   method assemblageFetch() to extract species sets (species assemblages) &
        the associated life history data.

Changes in version 0.1-7
NEW FEATURES
    o   method metadataUpdate() to compute taxa-level metadata  once a project is set.
    o   A new utility function, rangeFetch(), to fetch a range from a rangeMapper project.

Changes in version 0.1-5

BUG FIXES
    o   fixed a bug in vertices().

NEW FEATURES
    o   vertices is a new method of general use. Extract vertices from a
        SpatialPolygonsDataFrame and optionally applies an aggregating function
        to each Polygon.
    o   rangeTraits() & processRanges () changed to work with vertices().

Changes in version 0.1-3

NEW FEATURES
    o   rangeMapProcess-methods. Small-range polygons (i.e. smaller than a canvas cell)
        will return as many cells as there are 'Polygon'- s(e.g. each polygon will snap
        to the nearest canvas cell).
